  Scenario: Create a new user
    Given A Fresh App
    When I setup a JSON API Request
    And "POST" to "/api/register"
    And have type "users"
    And have faker attribute "email" from "internet.email"
    And have faker attribute "password" from "internet.password"
    And have attribute "password-confirmation" clone value of attribute "password"
    And send request
    Then I get JSON API Result
    And with attribute "email" matching request attribute "email"

    Given A Fresh App
    And Seed the "users" table with data
      | email                  | password |
